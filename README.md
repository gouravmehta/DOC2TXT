# DOC2TXT
DocX is a format used by the latest versions of Microsoft Word to save a document to a file.

Rendering a Microsoft Word file as it is presented in the program is not an easy task.

This class can perform a simpler but useful task of extracting the text used in the document file saved in DocX format.
